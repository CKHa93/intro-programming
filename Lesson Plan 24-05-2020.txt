Lesson Plan 24-05-2020

----- Things that would have been useful -----
- String formating
- Integer division
- Dictionaries
- List append
- Sets
- While loops

----- Functions -----
- Main statement in python
- Modules vs standalone code
- Code style, modularity, variable naming
- passing a function as an argument
- recursion

----- Homework -----
Every answer should accept command line arguments
1. Write three functions that multiply every element of an integer list:
	a. using for loops
	b. using while loops
	c. using recursion
2. Write a function that applies an operation to every element of a list. Use this to:
	a. Capitalize every word in a list
	b. Adds one to every integer in a list
	c. Appends the sum of all integers and strings as the last list item
3. Write a function that computes the first N fibonacci numbers
	a. using a for loop
	b. using recursion
